Python's `if __name__ == "__main__":` implemented in PHP
--------------------------------------------------------

Python has a way to call a script and make available only its classes & functions without executing lines of code outside of those classes and functions.

One use-case for this feature: testing. A script can be accessed to test its classes & functions without executing non-targeted code.

This is a way to achieve similar functionality in PHP.
